This is my third full stack web app. This project showcases my understanding of front and back end integration through the use of tools such as Node.js, Express.js, Express-Handlebars, as well as all of the regular front end tools such as Bootstrap, Javascript, and Jquery. I built upon my foundation of knowledge from my last project, but used a MongoDB database while also following the MVC code design paradigm.
